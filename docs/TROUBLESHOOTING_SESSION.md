# CC Release Monitor - Remote Approval System Troubleshooting Session

## Session Date: 2025-08-19

## Overview
This document chronicles the implementation of a remote approval system for Claude Code sessions through a Telegram bot, building upon an existing CC Release Monitor bot. The system was successfully built but encountered issues with the Telegram bot not responding to commands.

## Initial Context

### Starting Point
- **Existing System**: CC Release Monitor - a Telegram bot that monitors the `anthropics/claude-code` repository for new commits and changelog updates
- **Original Structure**: The project had a nested folder structure with the main code in `CC-Release-Monitor/CC-Release-Monitor/`
- **User Request**: Upgrade the bot to serve as a remote controller for Claude Code sessions, allowing approval/denial of Claude's tool use requests via Telegram

## What Was Built

### 1. System Architecture

We designed and implemented a complete remote approval system with the following components:

#### Core Components Created

1. **Approval Queue System** (`src/models/approval.py`)
   - SQLite-based persistent storage for approval requests
   - Full CRUD operations for managing requests
   - Automatic timeout handling (60 seconds)
   - Statistics and cleanup functions
   - Request tracking with unique IDs

2. **IPC Server** (`src/ipc_server.py`)
   - FastAPI-based HTTP server running on port 8765
   - RESTful API endpoints:
     - `POST /approval/request` - Submit new approval request
     - `GET /approval/status/{id}` - Check request status
     - `POST /approval/respond` - Submit approval decision
     - `GET /approval/pending` - Get pending requests
     - `GET /approval/stats` - Get statistics
   - WebSocket support for real-time notifications
   - Background task processing

3. **Claude Code Hook** (`.claude/hooks/remote_approval.py`)
   - Intercepts PreToolUse events from Claude Code
   - Smart filtering system:
     - Auto-approves safe tools (Read, Grep, LS, TodoWrite)
     - Auto-approves safe commands (ls, pwd, echo, date)
     - Requires approval for sensitive operations (rm, sudo, Write, Edit)
   - Polls IPC server for approval with 55-second timeout
   - Falls back to local approval if server unavailable

4. **Telegram Bot Integration** (`src/bot_approval.py`)
   - `ApprovalHandler` class for managing approval workflows
   - Interactive inline keyboards with buttons:
     - ‚úÖ Approve
     - ‚ùå Deny
     - üìù Deny with Reason
     - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Details
   - Background monitoring task for new requests
   - User authorization system
   - Commands:
     - `/start_approval` - Start monitoring
     - `/stop_approval` - Stop monitoring
     - `/approval_status` - View statistics

5. **Enhanced Main Bot** (`remote_bot.py`)
   - Combines original release monitoring with approval system
   - Runs IPC server in background thread
   - Unified command interface
   - Auto-starts both monitoring systems

### 2. File Structure Created

```

```

### 3. Configuration System

#### Environment Variables (.env)
```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<bot_token>
AUTHORIZED_USERS=<telegram_user_ids>
APPROVAL_IPC_PORT=8765
APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=55
```

#### Claude Code Settings (.claude/settings.json)
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/remote_approval.py\"",
        "timeout": 60
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### 4. Dependencies Added

Updated `requirements.txt` with:
- fastapi==0.104.1
- uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
- pydantic==2.5.0
- websockets==12.0

All dependencies were successfully installed in virtual environment.

## Implementation Steps Taken

### Step 1: Architecture Design
- Created comprehensive design document
- Planned communication flow between components
- Designed database schema for approval requests

### Step 2: Core Infrastructure
1. Created models package with ApprovalRequest and ApprovalQueue classes
2. Implemented IPC server with FastAPI
3. Set up SQLite database for persistence

### Step 3: Hook Implementation
1. Created remote_approval.py hook script
2. Implemented smart filtering logic
3. Added polling mechanism with timeout handling

### Step 4: Telegram Bot Integration
1. Created ApprovalHandler class
2. Implemented inline keyboard interface
3. Added monitoring background task
4. Integrated with main bot

### Step 5: Deployment Setup
1. Created launcher scripts
2. Set up virtual environment
3. Configured environment variables

## Current Issue

### Problem Description
The Telegram bot successfully starts and connects to Telegram's servers, but **does not respond to the `/start` command** or any other commands.

### Symptoms
1. Bot starts without errors
2. IPC server initializes successfully
3. Database created properly
4. Bot shows as online in Telegram
5. **No response when sending commands**

### Error Encountered
Initially had a Markdown parsing error:
```
telegram.error.BadRequest: Can't parse entities: can't find end of the entity starting at byte offset 809
```

This was fixed by removing parentheses from the message, but the bot still doesn't respond.

### Current Status
- Bot Token: ‚úÖ Successfully configured (8227070978:AAEUAtniDhMWqYYqPwhSOgmRuzzgaky2vv8)
- Bot Running: ‚úÖ Process active
- IPC Server: ‚úÖ Running on port 8765
- Database: ‚úÖ Initialized at data/approvals.db
- User Authorization: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs User ID (can't get it without /start working)
- **Command Response: ‚ùå Not working**

## Troubleshooting Attempted

1. **Fixed Markdown Error**: Removed problematic parentheses from welcome message
2. **Verified Token**: Confirmed bot token is correctly set in .env
3. **Checked Logs**: No errors shown after Markdown fix
4. **Restarted Bot**: Multiple times with same result
5. **Verified File Paths**: All modules correctly placed

## Potential Issues to Investigate

1. **Bot Permissions**: Check if bot has proper permissions in BotFather
2. **Token Validity**: Verify token is for the correct bot
3. **Network Issues**: Check if there are firewall/proxy issues
4. **Handler Registration**: Verify command handlers are properly registered
5. **Async Loop**: Check if event loop is running correctly
6. **Duplicate Bot Instances**: Ensure no other instance is using the same token

## Code Locations

### Key Files Modified/Created
- `remote_bot.py` - Main bot file (line 86 had the Markdown issue)
- `src/bot_approval.py` - Approval handler implementation
- `src/ipc_server.py` - IPC server for communication
- `src/models/approval.py` - Data models
- `.claude/hooks/remote_approval.py` - Claude Code hook
- `.env` - Configuration with bot token

### Working Components
- ‚úÖ IPC Server starts and runs
- ‚úÖ Database initialization
- ‚úÖ Virtual environment setup
- ‚úÖ All dependencies installed
- ‚úÖ Bot connects to Telegram

### Non-Working Components
- ‚ùå Command handlers not responding
- ‚ùå Can't get User ID without /start working
- ‚ùå Can't test approval system without bot commands

## Next Steps for New Session

1. **Verify Bot Setup**:
   - Check bot with BotFather (/mybots)
   - Ensure bot is not blocked
   - Try creating a new bot token

2. **Debug Command Handlers**:
   - Add debug logging to command handlers
   - Check if update.message exists
   - Verify handler registration order

3. **Test Minimal Bot**:
   - Create simple test bot with just /start
   - Isolate the issue from approval system

4. **Check Event Loop**:
   - Verify application.run_polling() is working
   - Check for any blocking operations

5. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Try webhooks instead of polling
   - Use different bot library version
   - Test with original simple_bot.py

## Summary

We successfully built a comprehensive remote approval system for Claude Code with all components working except for the crucial Telegram bot command handling. The architecture is solid, the code is complete, but there's an issue with the bot receiving/processing commands that needs to be resolved.

The system includes:
- ‚úÖ Complete approval workflow implementation
- ‚úÖ Database persistence
- ‚úÖ IPC communication
- ‚úÖ Claude Code integration
- ‚úÖ Smart filtering logic
- ‚ùå Working Telegram bot commands

All code is in place and the infrastructure is running, but the bot's command handlers aren't triggering when users send messages.

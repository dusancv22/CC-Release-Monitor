## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Get Your Telegram Bot Token
1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
2. Create a new bot with `/newbot`
3. Choose a name and username for your bot
4. Save the bot token (looks like `123456789:ABCdefGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz`)

### 2. Install the Bot
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository_url>
cd CC-Release-Monitor

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your bot token
```

### 3. Configure Settings
Edit `.env` file with your settings:
```env
# Required: Your Telegram bot token
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here

# Optional: GitHub token for higher rate limits (recommended)
GITHUB_API_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# Optional: Monitoring configuration
CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES=30
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### 4. Run the Bot
```bash
# Start the bot
python run.py

# Or run in background (Linux/macOS)
nohup python run.py &

# Or run as Windows service
# See docs/setup.md for service installation
```

### 5. Subscribe to Notifications
1. Find your bot on Telegram by username
2. Send `/start` to begin
3. Send `/subscribe` to enable notifications
4. Send `/help` to see all available commands

## Available Commands

- `/start` - Initialize bot and get welcome message
- `/help` - Show all available commands and usage
- `/subscribe` - Enable release notifications
- `/unsubscribe` - Disable release notifications  
- `/status` - Check subscription status and bot health
- `/check` - Manually check for new releases now
- `/last_release` - Show details of the latest Claude Code release
- `/preferences` - Configure notification settings (future)

- **Complete Privacy**: No third parties have access to your notification preferences
- **Unlimited Scaling**: Add as many users as you want without per-user fees

### vs. Manual GitHub Checking
- **Automated Monitoring**: Never miss important updates while you're busy
- **Rich Notifications**: Get formatted release notes directly in Telegram
- **Team Coordination**: Keep everyone informed with shared notifications
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintain local history of all releases

### vs. GitHub's Built-in Notifications
- **Telegram Integration**: Notifications where you actually see them
- **Rich Formatting**: Better presentation of release information
- **Customizable Timing**: Control when and how you receive notifications
- **Multi-User Support**: Share notifications with team or family

## Contributing

4. Follow the established code structure and testing standards

## Support & Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:
- **Bot not responding**: Check bot token in `.env` file
